Prologue:

  Osaka nights have their own heartbeat, wild, raw, and untamed. Under neon lights humming with promise and danger, a single name once ruled the alleyway whispers: Riku Takahashi. With iron fists and fiery eyes, he commanded respect and fear in equal measure. But the power is as fickle as memory, and the night that changed everything ended not with a roar, but with screeching tires and a split second of blinding pain.

  When Riku awoke, the world was quieter. His hands still bore the scars of a life he could not remember; his gaze, once fierce, now cast downward. Doctors called it a miracle. He called it emptiness.

  On the other side of Japan, Tokyo yawned and stretched, oblivious to the storm drifting its way. Here, Riku wore a new mask: quiet, polite, almost invisible. He made every effort to fit in, calculating his steps, folding his ambitions into textbook margins. But sometimes, during afternoon shadows or the glint of a threat in the hallway something primal flickered in his eyes, the echo of a king with no kingdom.

  Not everyone was blind to it. Aoi Minazuki, the brilliant class rep with her unreadable smile, watched him with suspicion and a strange familiarity. Ren Kurobane, the local legend and cold king of the schoolâ€™s underworld, sensed a rival and bristled for battle. Daichi Sato, more bluster than bravery, clung to Riku in the hope of borrowed strength. And far away in Osaka, Haruto Shiba, haunted by broken brotherhood, heard rumors, the ghost of his friend now stalking new territory.

  In a city buzzing with secrets and grudges, the past was only waiting for its chance to strike back. And Riku, whether he remembered or not, was destined to learn, but some things, the fists never forget.
