  By the second day, the whispers about Riku Takahashi gained momentum, ricocheting between classrooms and echoing in stairwells. Daichi kept pace beside Riku, filling the empty spaces with chatter about what clubs to avoid, which teachers actually checked homework, who was secretly dating. Riku appreciated the company, even if he spent most of the walk nodding along.


  The tension in the air felt different today, a subtle shift in the way students looked at him. Some were openly curious, others hung back, waiting to see what the new kid would do. It wasn’t long before trouble found him.


  It happened between class periods, in the corridor beneath the stairwell, a place thick with echoes and the smell of old broom closets. Riku was heading to his locker when he heard the laughter, a pointed, ugly sound that bounced off the tiles. Three older boys stood blocking the hallway. One of them was big, with broad shoulders and a swagger that told everyone this was his domain. The ringleader's name was Goro, Daichi had already warned him about guys like him, ones who preyed on the quiet kids.


  “There he is, Tokyo’s newest tough guy,” Goro sneered, stepping into Riku’s path. His friends watched with hungry eyes, expecting a show. “You really must think you’re something, Osaka boy. You've been looking at us all funny. Maybe you need to learn how things work here.”


  Riku kept his face calm, heart ticking a little faster. He remembered what the counselor had told him his first day. “Stay out of trouble. Focus on your studies.” All he really wanted to do was get his textbooks and disappear into the background. At first, he tried to step past, mumbling something polite.


  But Goro’s arm shot out, slamming Riku against the locker. A hush fell in the hallway, a ripple of curiosity spreading as other students hesitated at the ends of the corridor. “Where do you think you’re going?” Goro taunted. “Or maybe you forgot how to speak?”


  Riku stared at the floor, careful with his breath, but there it was that old itch gathering in his muscles. It surged, familiar and foreign all at once.


  “I don’t want any trouble,” he said, voice low.


  Goro’s buddies snickered, but before they could close in, a voice rang out sharp and clear. “Let him go, Goro. Last time you tried this, you had to clean toilets for a month.” It was Aoi Minazuki. She stood at the edge of the crowd, her tone cutting and controlled.


  Goro’s sneer wavered for a moment, but his pride kept him on course. “Stay out of it, Minazuki. This is between me and the Osaka punk.”


  Riku met Goro’s eyes and something happened. His mind went oddly still, his body tense but relaxed a strange paradox. He felt the weight and balance of Goro’s shove, calculated before he even knew what he was doing. When Goro lunged again, Riku sidestepped without thinking. Time slowed, the world narrowing to the flash of a fist coming at his face, the sound of breath hissing through clenched teeth. Riku ducked, turned, grabbed Goro’s outstretched arm, and shifted his weight just slightly. Goro stumbled forward, hitting the locker hard and falling to his knees, stunned.


  For a long heartbeat, nobody moved. Goro stared up, stunned and embarrassed, his friends pulling him away, muttering under their breath. The crowd faded just as quickly as it had gathered, whispers flying. Riku stood in the middle of it all, looking at his hands, trying to process what just happened.


  Aoi approached, her gaze unreadable. “You know how to handle yourself.” Her words were more observation than compliment.


  Riku shrugged, the old ache in his knuckles burning with memory. “I don’t remember my past… but my fists do.”


  Behind him, Daichi finally made it through the dispersing crowd, eyes wide with awe and a little terror. “Riku! You’re supposed to study, not suplex the senior!”


  The rest of the day passed in a blur. Some students looked at Riku with awe, others kept their distance. The story of what happened spread faster than any rumor Daichi could dream up. But all Riku could think about was the sensation that still thrummed in his veins, the sense that no matter how hard he tried, he could never quite escape the ghost living in his muscles.


  And somewhere in the school, Ren Kurobane had been watching.
