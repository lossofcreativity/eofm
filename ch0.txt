Chapter 1: The Transfer:

  The train’s rhythmic clatter was the only sound Riku Takahashi trusted. Faces blurred past the window, salarymen, students, dreamers, and drifters each too lost in their own morning to notice the boy with the heavy duffel bag and heavier secrets. Tokyo was nothing like Osaka: the city pulsed, but not with the same chaotic life he dimly remembered as if from a movie he’d watched too young.

  “Next stop, Suginohara Station,” the conductor’s voice chimed. Riku gripped the worn strap of his bag, palms sweating. This would be the first day of his new life. The doctors had called it a ‘fresh start.’ He called it an empty page, both a blessing and a curse.

  Suginohara High loomed like a fortress among office towers and convenience stores. Its gates buzzed with life: students clustered in groups, laughter snapping through the air like banners. Each uniformed figure was an island, connected by gossip and glances. Riku kept his head low as he entered, feeling the first prickling stares. Transfer students were rare here and rarer still the ones who looked so uncomfortable in their own skin.

  Inside, the main hall was a river of noise. Riku’s name echoed uncertainly as a teacher with frazzled hair beckoned him. “Let’s introduce you to your class, Takahashi-kun. Remember, just relax.”

  The classroom’s murmurs dropped to a hush when he entered. Sunlight caught a dust mote parade between the rows of desks. “This is Riku Takahashi,” the teacher announced. “He’s just moved here from Osaka. Please make him feel welcome.”

  Eyes bored into him, some curious, a few cold, others already dismissive. He caught a single pair, sharp and calculating, belonging to a girl with neat black hair and the crispest uniform: Aoi Minazuki. She barely nodded. A blond boy behind her grinned, nudged his neighbor, and whispered loudly enough for Riku to catch, “Maybe he failed out there or something…”

  Assigned to a seat near the back, Riku tried not to notice the whispers. As the teacher droned on, he glanced around, taking stock counting exits, noting faces, an old, automatic caution that felt instinctive, not learned. When the lesson ended, desks shifted into clusters and the chatter grew. Before he could vanish into the crowd, a gangly, bespectacled boy flopped into the seat beside him.

  “Name’s Daichi Sato, self-appointed guide to the lost and bewildered!” the boy declared, offering a crooked handshake. “They say Tokyo’s a jungle, but don’t worry stick with me and you’ll make it. Do you play any sports? Wait, don't tell me, you’re a shogi prodigy, right?”

  Riku chuckled softly, the sound unfamiliar even to him. Maybe making a friend wouldn’t be so bad.

  But as the day wore on, odd things happened a senior tripped him in the hallway, muttered something about ‘Osaka rats’; a basketball soared too close to his head during gym but, shockingly, he caught it one-handed without thinking, earning some wide-eyed looks from classmates; an icy stare from the school’s most infamous student, Ren Kurobane, followed him during lunch, a silent challenge.

  And through it all, Aoi Minazuki watched. Every time Riku felt eyes burning into his back, it was her reading him like a riddle she begrudged having to solve.

  At the day’s end, as students poured into the city’s veins, Daichi tagged after Riku, chattering about school clubs and lunch line politics. But Riku just stared at his hands unscarred to him, though strangers sometimes flinched at his grip.
He shut his eyes, hoping for dreams, fearing what they might reveal.

  He didn’t remember his past. But already, his fists ached with the memory.
